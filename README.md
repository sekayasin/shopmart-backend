# ShopMart 

A mini online E-commerce Business to Consumer platform for users (Sellers) to sell their products to users (Buyers). 

ShopMart is a mini Walmart clone designed to aid our learning and usage of the technologies being used in this project.

## Technologies Used

 - ShopMart consists of a [REST API Backend](https://github.com/sekayasin/shopmart-backend) developed using [Java SpringBoot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) and a [Front-end](https://github.com/sekayasin/shopmart-frontend) consuming it developed using [Reactjs](https://reactjs.org/)
 - The Backend runs on a [PostgreSQL Database](https://www.postgresql.org/), the World's Most Advanced Open Source Relational Database.
 - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), a popular containerization tool is used to create docker images for both our Backend and Frontend, which leads to faster production deployment and a more efficient containerization in production.

## Running the Dockerized Application

The application has been containerized and can be run using the docker-compose file

There is a `docker-compose.yml` file that can be run to start all the services of the application

Both the backend and front-end docker images are referenced in the docker-compose file

The images are hosted on docker-hub repository, hence they will be pulled once the application is started as instructed below.
